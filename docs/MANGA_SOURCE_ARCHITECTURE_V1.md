# Veil Manga Source Architecture v1

Status: architecture-first foundation, behind the existing product surface.

## Goal

Add manga/webtoon sources without coupling remote-site behavior to the EPUB/PDF reader, Room schema, or Compose UI. A source changing domain, requiring a challenge, or disappearing must not corrupt reading progress or library identity.

## Clean-room rule

Kotatsu-Redo is a high-value behavior and architecture reference only. Veil owns its interfaces, models, persistence and implementations. Do not copy or link GPL implementation code unless Eyad Studio explicitly accepts the resulting license obligations.

## Boundaries

### Source layer

`MangaSourceProvider` owns remote/local source behavior:

- search;
- details;
- chapters;
- pages;
- optional reverse-link resolution;
- declared capabilities;
- ordered primary/mirror domains.

Providers return source-neutral models and classified failures. They do not navigate UI, write Room directly, or own reader state.

### Stable identity

`SourceId` is independent from host/domain. `SourceMangaRef.key` is provider-stable and must not contain a mutable domain.

This permits:

- mirror/domain failover without identity rewrite;
- migration from a dead source to an alternative source;
- cached/offline state to survive host changes.

### Recovery and execution

Failures are classified into network, timeout, rate limit, blocked/challenge, auth, not found, parser changed, source removed, unsupported and unknown.

`SourceRecoveryPolicy` returns one recovery action. `SourceExecutionCoordinator` owns the bounded execution mechanics:

- maximum attempt budget;
- per-source semaphore/concurrency limit;
- runtime domain/mirror selection;
- rate-limit delay clamping;
- cancellation propagation;
- one challenge attempt per domain per operation;
- an explicit `SourceChallengeAdapter` boundary.

The coordinator intentionally does **not** choose a different source. Cross-source replacement requires canonical work matching and migration confidence and therefore remains a separate layer.

### Registry

`SourceRegistry` rejects duplicate IDs, provides deterministic ordering and filters providers by capability/language/content type.

## Deliberately not in this slice

- no live source website adapter;
- no network/HTML parser dependency;
- no concrete WebView/Cloudflare implementation;
- no Room schema changes;
- no library migration;
- no Manga UI;
- no reader-mode changes;
- no telemetry/community service.

That keeps the existing EPUB/PDF release candidate behavior unchanged.

## Completed foundation

1. **Source SDK contract**
   - stable source identity;
   - source-neutral manga/chapter/page models;
   - explicit capabilities;
   - classified failures.

2. **Execution coordinator**
   - bounded retry;
   - per-source concurrency;
   - cancellation propagation;
   - mirror/domain failover;
   - rate-limit clamp;
   - challenge adapter boundary;
   - anti-loop challenge guard.

3. **Fixture-backed contract proof**
   - search -> details -> chapters -> pages;
   - reverse URL resolution;
   - deterministic local provider;
   - no dependency on a live manga website.

## Next vertical slices

1. **Offline cache + progress model**
   - canonical work identity separated from `SourceMangaRef`;
   - chapter/page cache metadata;
   - resume state;
   - migration-safe keys.

2. **Alternatives / source replacement**
   - title/alt-title matching;
   - chapter number/volume alignment;
   - cover similarity as secondary evidence;
   - explicit confidence and manual confirmation;
   - transactionally migrate progress/favourites/download metadata.

3. **Reader vertical slice**
   - paged manga;
   - RTL page direction;
   - webtoon continuous mode;
   - zoom;
   - orientation/process restoration;
   - offline reopen.

## Verification state

- Pure-Kotlin compilation of the source foundation succeeds independently.
- GitHub Actions is currently failing before any workflow step starts: the observed jobs have no assigned runner and no step output.
- Full Android/Gradle verification remains required before merge.

## Quality gates

Before enabling Manga Hub in production:

- source failures never break EPUB/PDF reading;
- coroutine cancellation is never counted as source failure;
- no infinite challenge/retry loop;
- mirror switch preserves identity;
- source replacement preserves reading progress;
- offline chapter reopens without network;
- large/tall image zoom does not collapse or jump;
- RTL/webtoon modes restore after process death;
- parser/site changes fail visibly and recoverably;
- every source adapter has fixture-based compatibility tests.
